# Machine Learning Course

Welcome to the repository for my homework and projects from the Machine Learning Zoomcamp course.

## Course Overview

This repository is created to store my assignments and projects for the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp) offered by DataTalksClub. The course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to machine learning and familiarize participants with essential ML frameworks and tools.

### Course Structure

The course is divided into two main parts:

#### Part 1: Fundamentals of Machine Learning
- **Linear Regression**: Understand the basics of predicting continuous outcomes.
- **Classification**: Learn methods for predicting categorical outcomes.
- **Decision Trees**: Explore tree-based models for decision-making.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combine multiple models to improve performance.
- **Neural Networks**: Dive into the basics of deep learning and neural network architectures.

#### Part 2: Model Deployment
- **Flask**: Use Flask to create web applications and deploy ML models.
- **TensorFlow**: Work with TensorFlow for advanced machine learning and deep learning projects.
- **Kubernetes**: Learn about container orchestration and deploy models in a scalable way.

## Deadlines

Here are the deadlines for each homework and project.
